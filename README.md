<p>
This is a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. It is designed using the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and uses Handlebars to generate your HTML.

Users of the app can create a burger and add it to a database, then devour the burger which updates the devoured state in the database. After updating the state, the DOM will be updated to display the results on the webpage.
